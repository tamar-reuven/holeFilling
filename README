Need to be fixed: (Code works well without these changes)
    1. Class Point should have only 1 field- float value. There is no need to save locations x,y.

An example input:
    Image Path = "src/main/images/puppy2.png"
    Mask Path = "src/main/images/Mask.png"
    z = 2
    e = 0.01
    connectivity type = 8/4

An example input that includes converting image format:
    Image Path = "src/main/images/rabbit.jpg"
    Mask Path = "src/main/images/Mask.png"
    z = 2
    e = 0.01
    connectivity type = 8/4

Constraints:
    1. The image and the mask must be the same size NxN
    2. Connectivity type must be 4/8


The Following project contains:
 a. Main -
    1. takes input from user
    2. checks an image format and converts it if needed
    3. creates an image object
    4. calls method fillHole to fill the hole in the image
    5. calls method saveFilledImage to save the filled image

 b. Point - Object point represents a pixel

 c. Image - Object image represents the image we need to work on to fill te hole
    has the following methods: (except the constructor and the regular ones)
    1.saveFilledImage
    2.setRgbOfEachPixelInFilledImage

 d. ImageProcess - Processing the image (builds pixels matrix, finds hole set etc..)
    1.buildPixelsMat
    2.rgbToGrayscale
    3.findHoleSet
    4.findBoundarySet
    5.isHole

 e. HoleFillingCalc - calculating each color for each hole pixel with the given formula
    1.fillHole
    2.calcColor
    3.euclideanDistance

 f. ImageConverter - converts the image format
